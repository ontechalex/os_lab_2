### 1.0 INTRODUCTION

1.1 What is Simple Shell?
Simple Shell is a shell made by Alexander Campbell, Atharsan Kennedy, and Joey
Villafeurte. This shell can use most simple commands. This manual will outline
the functionalities of the shell and how to use its various commands. This shell
supports both command line input and batchfile input.

### 2.0 FEATURES

### 2.1 Special Characters

  '&' : Use the amerpsand symbol at the end of your command to have it run within
    the environment you are currently in.

  '>' : Used in I/O redirection, see section 2.3 for more information.

  '>>' : Used in I/O redirection, see section 2.3 for more information.

  '<' : Used in I/O redirection, see section 2.3 for more information.

###2.2 Basic Commands
  NAME cd <directory>

  DESCRIPTION
    The cd command will change the current working directory to the specified
  directory specified by <directory>. This will change the shell's execution
  environment to <directory>.

  NAME clr

  DESCRIPTION
    The clr command will clear the current screen in the terminal. This includes
    all outputs, previous inputs, etc.

  NAME dir <directory>

  DESCRIPTION
    The dir command will list information associated with the directory specified
  by <directory>.

  NAME dir <directory>

  DESCRIPTION
    The dir command will list information associated with the directory specified
  by <directory>.

  NAME environ

  DESCRIPTION
    The environ command will list all the environment variables as strings in the
  terminal. Environment variables are similar to commands in that they invoke a
  process, such as node in Node.js. These are set outside of the terminal.

  NAME echo <comment>

  DESCRIPTION
    The echo command will simply output whatever is in <comment>. This command can
  also be leveraged using i/o redirection to print from the output of another
  command (see 2.3 for an example.)

  NAME help

  DESCRIPTION
    The help command will display options and commands that are available to the user.

  NAME pause

  DESCRIPTION
    The pause command will pause the operation of the shell until more input is
  recieved.

  NAME quit

  DESCRIPTION
    The quit command will end the operation of the shell and exit the process.

### 2.3 I/O Redirection
    This shell also supports I/O redirection from and to files. This can be done by
  utlilizing the '>', '>>', and '<' characters. '>' and '>>' are used to direct
  output to a specified file while '<' takes input from a specified file. All the
  commands specified in the example sections can be used to test the command line.

  #### 2.3.1 EXAMPLE

  adder < in.txt

    In this example the adder will read whatever is in in.txt and use it as command
  line arguements to the program adder. This will then output to whatever the total
  is to the command line.

  #### 2.3.2 EXAMPLE

  adder 10 5 > out.txt

    In this example, the adder will take in 10 and 5 as the command line arguements.
  The result of this will then be sent to the file out.txt.

  #### 2.3.3 EXAMPLE

  adder 10 5 < in.txt > out.txt

    In this example, the shell will run the program adder using 10 and 5 as the
  command line arguements. In addition to this, it will read whatever is in in.txt
  and use that as additional command line arguements. The outout will then be directed
  to out.txt. Because we used the '>' it will truncate and overwrite whatever
  is there, if we wanted to append we would use the '>>' instead.

### 2.4 Other features
    In some cases a programmer may want to use a batchfile in order to run commands
  automatically. This can be done by specifying commands in a text file named
  "Batchfile.txt". The shell will then read the contents of the text file and
  attempt to run the commands.
